# DebugStifle
A KSP addon to allow for stifling the text input field of the debug console.

Sometimes the Debug Console's input field just randomly starts stealing your key commands, so this mod adds a toggle to turn off the input field.

Originally [developed](https://github.com/DMagic1/KSP_DebugStifle) by [DMagic](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/108704-18x-dmagics-modlets-most-ksp-18-updates-10-29-2019/), adopted and updated by [Clayel](https://github.com/Clayell/DebugStifle).

The underlying bug was [fixed recently](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/329) by [KSPCF 1.39.0](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/releases/tag/1.39.0), so this mod is likely redundant for users of KSPCF.
